                <strong>THE HARE</strong> was once boasting of his speed before the other animals. <em>“I have never yet been beaten,”</em> said he, <em>“when I put forth my full speed. I challenge any one here to race with me.”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                The Tortoise said quietly, <em>“I accept your challenge.”</em>  
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>“That is a good joke,”</em> said the Hare; <em>“I could dance round you all the way.”</em>
            </p>
        </div>
            <!-- This will be in-line with the previos div-->
        <div>
            <p>
                <em>“Keep your boasting till you’ve beaten,”</em> answered the Tortoise. <em>“Shall we race?”</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                So a course was fixed and a start was made. The Hare darted almost out of sight at once, but soon stopped and, to show his contempt for the Tortoise, lay down to have a nap. The Tortoise plodded on and plodded on, and when the Hare awoke from his nap, he saw the Tortoise just near the winning-post and could not run up in time to save the race. Then said the Tortoise:
            </p>
            <p>
                <em>“PLODDING WINS THE RACE.”</em>
                <ul> 
                    <li>"PLODDING WINS THE RACE"</li>
                    <li>"PLODDING WINS THE RACE"</li>
                    <li>"PLODDING WINS THE RACE"</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
